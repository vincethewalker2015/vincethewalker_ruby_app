Was looking for a simplified way to pull the data from webserver log

1. 'Git commit 263337c290096017aa9c78844dad12c7431e9ba2'
Set up Pathway to pull data from webserver log

Using initialize here allowed me to create @logs as the object as well as a way to
connect with the webserver.log. I was able to run this :
  "ruby lib/parser.rb webserver.log" 
    -- Did not produce any here

2 'Git commit 9b1012b0cf793c149ff67c0cbfb5dc86d860ede8'
  Created 'most visits' function

  Learned that separating site name from ip address - use a regex, 
  look at an ips length and sort it, Using map method (runs each enumerable object)


3 'Git commit 465aa724924dcc2610a2616c3641d1ddcbee5aad'
  Created Unique visits function

  Using Ruby's .unique removes duplicates
